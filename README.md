# Polygon Name Service
[Live Web App](https://polygon-name-service.trm313.repl.co/)

This app is connected to a smart contract that lets you mint a unique web3 'domain' name, and store a record that you want anyone to be able to access!

From the web app you can mint your own domain, as well as update the data record associated with domains you've minted. When minting a domain, you will receive an NFT for your domain.

## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the `.replit` file.
